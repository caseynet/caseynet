At the suggestion of my local flying club, I pursued the [Radiomaster](https://www.radiomasterrc.com) brand of transmitter for my new-found hobby. In fairness, many of them are all retired and have plenty of time to tinker. 

On the surface, the idea of the [Radiomaster TX16S](https://www.radiomasterrc.com/products/tx16s-mark-ii-radio-controller?variant=42817679655143) (my chosen model) seemed great. An open-source operating system, [EdgeTX](http://www.edgetx.org), provides compatibility with various protocols and receiver types used in the industry. The hardware is affordable and generally well-reviewed. 

Unfortunately, that is where the fun ends.

As great as that all sounds, the rub is support. Hardware support is next-to-zero, software help is relegated to YouTube videos or Facebook help groups, and even local support came up short. I simply don't have time to tinker (but I sure wish I did!). My goal is to get in the air.

## Hello, Spektrum

I'm an Apple guy. I appreciate interconnected systems, walled gardens, and companies that answer the phone. I also know that comes with some limitations and potential price gouging, but life goes on.

I ordered the Spektrum NX10+ (20-channel transmitter) as soon as possible.
