## Hockey Coaching Tips & Tricks

Coaching youth hockey is a rewarding experience, but it comes with a lot of "to do" items and other things coaches much remember. This is a collection of my learning for my own memory, but also so it might be useful for other newbies.


### Yearly Requirements

Coaching credentials must be kept up-to-date, but not every item is required yearly. 

1. Complete your yearly USA Hockey registration and obtain the confirmation number.
2. Complete your background check if necessary (every two years).
3. Complete any additional CEP training courses and/or age modules by Dec. 31 of that calendar year.
